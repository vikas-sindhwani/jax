When being rigorous, we should think of $v$ as a linear map $v : \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and when we write $v \\partial f(x)$ we mean function composition $v \\circ \\partial f(x)$, where the types work out because $\\partial f(x) : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$. But in the common case we can identify $v$ with a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ and use the two almost interchageably, just like we might sometimes flip between \"column vectors\" and \"row vectors\" without much comment.\n",
